### Virtual Environments
Virtual environments in Python are like a self-contained directory that contains the installation for a particular version of python. 
It is good because you don't have to worry about the version it is using when running the programs (e.g python3 {file}.py, python {file}.py). The environment executable will take care of it.

To create a new virtual environment on mac / linux, follow the next steps (for windows it is slighly different):
1. Create project root directory
2. run the command `python3.7 -m venv env` (or whatever version it is)
3. run the command `source env/bin/activate` - a line with read `(env) ...` or something along these lines should be printed out

This configuration will be attached to the terminal session. If you reopen it, to have the virtual environment set up again, just reexecute step #3
